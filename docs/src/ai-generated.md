# ⚠️ AI-Generated Package - Important Notice

## Generation Method

**OnlineStatsChains.jl v0.1.0** was entirely generated using **Claude Code** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), an AI coding assistant from Anthropic.

### What This Means

This package was created through:
- **AI-driven development** from a detailed EARS specification
- **Automated code generation** with human oversight
- **AI-written tests** using BDD methodology
- **AI-generated documentation** including all tutorials and examples

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Potential Risks

Users should be aware of the following considerations when using AI-generated code:

#### 1. **Code Quality & Correctness**
- ✅ **Mitigated by**: 72 BDD tests, all passing
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Edge cases may not be fully covered despite high test coverage
- **Recommendation**: Review critical paths and add application-specific tests

#### 2. **Security Concerns**
- ✅ **Mitigated by**: No external dependencies beyond OnlineStatsBase.jl
- ⚠️ **Risk**: AI-generated code may have subtle vulnerabilities
- **Recommendation**: Security audit before production use in sensitive contexts

#### 3. **Maintenance & Understanding**
- ✅ **Mitigated by**: Comprehensive documentation and clear code structure
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Original developers may not have deep implementation knowledge
- **Recommendation**: Study the codebase thoroughly before modifications

#### 4. **Edge Cases & Corner Cases**
- ✅ **Mitigated by**: BDD tests cover main scenarios
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Unusual usage patterns may trigger unexpected behavior
- **Recommendation**: Test thoroughly in your specific use case

#### 5. **Performance Characteristics**
- ✅ **Mitigated by**: Algorithms designed for O(V+E) complexity
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Real-world performance may vary with specific data patterns
- **Recommendation**: Benchmark with your actual workload

#### 6. **API Design**
- ✅ **Mitigated by**: Based on detailed EARS specification
- ⚠️ **Risk**: API may not follow all Julia community best practices
- **Recommendation**: Provide feedback if you find API inconsistencies

## 🔍 Verification Steps Taken
